This Python keylogger tracks keystrokes and mouse movements on a system, providing a way to monitor user activity. The keylogger consists of three main files:

    main.py: Captures keyboard input and writes keystrokes to a log file (log.txt).
    mouse.py: Tracks mouse movements and logs the position to the console.
    control.py: Demonstrates keyboard and mouse control using the pynput library.

Modules Used

    pynput: Provides cross-platform support for controlling and monitoring keyboard and mouse inputs.
